# AI-Powered Insurance Policy Information Chatbot

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Insurance companies offer various policies (health, life, auto, home), and customers often have questions about coverage, premiums, claims, etc. An AI chatbot helps provide timely, accurate answers, improving satisfaction and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an AI chatbot that understands natural language and assists users in understanding insurance policies.

## 💡 Features

- Query insurance documents (health, coverage, premiums, claims) using natural language
- Responses generated by FLAN-T5 language model
- Fallback to human agent simulation for complex queries
- Real-time interaction using Streamlit-based UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **LLM:** FLAN-T5 (via HuggingFace pipeline)
- **Embeddings:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` using SentenceTransformers
- **Vector Store:** Chroma DB for storing and retrieving document chunks
- **UI:** Streamlit (chat interface)
- **PDF Parsing:** LangChain's PyPDFLoader and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
📁 data/                        # Insurance PDFs
📁 vectorstore/                # Chroma vector DB
📄 app.py                      # Streamlit chatbot app
📄 ingest.py                   # PDF loading and embedding
📄 README.md                   # Project overview
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Ingest PDF using `ingest.py`, which loads, splits, and embeds policy documents into Chroma DB.
2. `app.py` launches a chatbot UI where users can ask queries.
3. LangChain's `RetrievalQA` fetches relevant chunks and uses FLAN-T5 to answer.
4. Some queries trigger fallback ("connect to human agent") logic.
